## About
A timed single page quiz to test the user on terminology related to Javascript and Web Development.

The provided user story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Technologies Used
For this project the technologies and languages below were implemented:

- HTML/CSS/Vanilla Javascript
- Bootstrap

## Application Overview
As a user, you are greeted to a large blue button that directs you to start the quiz. At this point a timer is triggered for the questions to be answered and the first question is rendered on the page. All additional questions render on the page as you answer further questions. You will be alerted if you incorrectly answer one of the questions and will be provided with the correct answer. Once you have reached the end of the quiz the user will be alerted on their score, which is currently being updated to the console.

Due to last minute time constrains I was unable to fully render the page to include the users initials and score. This is something that will be addressed after the bootcamp (see Future Developments).

## Future Developments
My future plans for this application are to expand the base of questions and utilize the quiz as a boiler plate template that could be utilized as a component of another project or application or as a stand alone quiz - easily edited with the necessary logic in place. The subject matter could continue as Computer Science themed or easily adapt to a separate topic.

## Comments
I had initially skipped this challenge because at the time it was very much over my head and what I had assembled was not nearly substantive enough. At the end of the bootcamp I found myself ready to revisit this project. I reviewed the expectations for the project and mapped out ahead of time steps I could take to create this project in a short time (hence the excessive comments in the js file), with my bootcamp ending on 2/13/24. Unfortunately due to time constraints I was not able to implement the screen rendering of the user score. This will certainly be a personal future development that I will plan on implementing post-bootcamp.
